Live Demo coming soon ...


The first page is the index page that greets users and as your scroll down you will see
all the new items that have just arrived in store as well as categories for Apparel, Sneakers & 
Accessories. Those links will redirect you to the lookbook pages where you can add all the 
items you want to a cart.

The About page gives you a brief history of the company and what we stand for as well
as a mission statement.

The Lookbook page displays all the latest and greatest trends as well as what some of the items 
we offer online. 

The shop page displays all items in store that you will be able to purchase buy selecting add to cart and then you 
will be able to checkout with those items. 

The Contact page displays all relevant information in regards to contacting us. There is a 
map to our location as well as our contact details like email, address and telephone number
as well as an email form that will be sent to us on completion.

The Cart page will display all items you have selected to purchase. You will be able to 
delete items within the cart or change the quantity. If you refresh the browser all your 
items will still be displayed in the cart, so you do have the ability to pay whenever without
losing items.
